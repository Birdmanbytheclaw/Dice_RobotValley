Every one you come across is a robot trying to fight you.

they do not fight with fists but probability

The Game Consists of

one physical player robot and one nonplayer robot
three characteristics

        Speed- rolled on a d8 and a d12
        Cunning- rolled on two d20's 
Round 2
	Strength - if won last round + 1 on each dice to ammont of sides
	Speed - Same as strength
	Cunning - given the chance to Roll extra times for every rolll win (can accumulate)
Final rounds
	Strength - If ability to roll higher than the round number you may roll otherwise you must outsmart or die
	Speed - Same as strength
	Cunning - if you havent used a single reroll/ have more rerolls than the level number you can roll all and add together to win 
Each round Consists of 2 initial Waves of Rolling
one for each characteristic (the 2 d20s for cunning will count as one)(there is a reson for 2 seperate rolls)and each side
*yes you roll for each characteristic every round*
if physical player loses for any reason their is one more round of rolling to determine a better outcome depending on terms of loss
There are a few ways to win but the main way is to roll higher strength AND speed
the BEST way to win is to Max ot your cunning because if both of your cunning rolls win and neither of your others do you still win By thinking your way out of conflict
