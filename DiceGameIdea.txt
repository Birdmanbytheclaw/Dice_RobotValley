Name of the Game is Valley of the Bots

Every one you come across is a robot trying to fight you.
you are also a robot
they do not fight with fists but probability

The Game Consists of

one physical player robot and one nonplayer robot
three characteristics
        Strength- rolled on a singular d20
        Speed- rolled on a singular d8
        Cunning- rolled on two d20's (adding the Values together)

Each round Consists of 2 initial Waves of Rolling
one for each characteristic (the 2 d20s for cunning will count as one)(there is a reson for 2 seperate rolls)and each side
*yes you roll for each characteristic every round*
if physical player loses for any reason their is one more round of rolling to determine a better outcome depending on terms of loss
There are a few ways to win but the main way is to roll higher strength AND speed
the BEST way to win is to Max ot your cunning because if both of your cunning rolls win and neither of your others do you still win By thinking your way out of conflict
